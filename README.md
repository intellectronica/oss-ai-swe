# The Community Guide to Open-Source AI Software Craft

**[oss-ai-swe.org](https://oss-ai-swe.org/)**

Welcome to the Community Guide to Open-Source AI Software Craft! This project is a collaborative, open-source guide and knowledge base for software engineers working with open-source AI tools and workflows. Our goal is to help the community share best practices, tools, and insights for building, maintaining, and contributing to open-source AI software tools.

## üåê About the Website

This website is built using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and is designed to be easy to read, search, and contribute to. It serves as a living document for:

- Guides and tutorials for open-source AI development
- Tool and library overviews
- Best practices and workflows
- Community-contributed tips and resources

You can browse the site online or build it locally to preview your changes.

## üöÄ How It Works

The site is powered by MkDocs, a static site generator for project documentation. All content lives in the `docs/` directory as Markdown files. The navigation and site configuration are managed in `mkdocs.yml`.

**Key files and folders:**

- `docs/` ‚Äî All documentation content (Markdown files)
- `mkdocs.yml` ‚Äî Site configuration and navigation
- `stylesheets/extra.css` ‚Äî Custom styles

To view the site locally:

```sh
pip install mkdocs
mkdocs serve
```
Then open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Update the Website

1. **Edit or add Markdown files** in the `docs/` directory. Each file becomes a page on the site.
2. **Update `mkdocs.yml`** to add new pages to the navigation.
3. **Preview locally** with `mkdocs serve`.
4. **Commit your changes** and open a pull request (see below).
