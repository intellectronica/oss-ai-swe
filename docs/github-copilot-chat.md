**GitHub Copilot Chat is an AI-powered chat interface for Visual Studio Code that assists with various coding-related tasks.**

The GitHub Copilot Chat extension for Visual Studio Code brings the power of GitHub Copilot directly into the editor, providing a chat-based interface for interacting with the AI assistant. While the extension itself is open-source under the MIT license, the underlying GitHub Copilot service that powers it is a proprietary, subscription-based product. This page focuses on the open-source VS Code extension.
