**OpenCode is a terminal-based AI coding assistant that helps you with a variety of tasks, such as answering questions about your code, generating new code, and debugging and fixing errors.**

OpenCode is a powerful and flexible AI coding assistant that runs in your terminal. It's designed to be a versatile tool that can help you with a wide range of programming tasks, from answering simple questions to generating complex code. The tool is built with a modular architecture, which allows it to be easily extended and customized to fit your specific needs.

### Key Features

*   **Terminal-Based Interface:** OpenCode is a command-line tool, which means you can use it with any IDE or text editor. This makes it a flexible tool that can be easily integrated into any developer's workflow.
*   **Multiple AI Models:** OpenCode supports a variety of AI models, giving you the flexibility to choose the best model for your needs. This means you can use models from different providers, or even use local models that you've trained yourself.

*   **Client/Server Architecture:** OpenCode uses a client/server architecture, which allows you to run the AI model on a separate machine from your development machine. This can be useful for a variety of reasons, such as if you want to use a more powerful machine to run the AI model, or if you want to share the AI model with other developers on your team.
