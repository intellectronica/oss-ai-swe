**opencode is a terminal-based AI coding assistant that helps you with a variety of tasks, such as answering questions about your code, generating new code, and debugging and fixing errors.**

opencode is a powerful and flexible AI coding assistant that runs in your terminal. It's designed to be a versatile tool that can help you with a wide range of programming tasks, from answering simple questions to generating complex code. The tool is built with a modular architecture, which allows it to be easily extended and customized to fit your specific needs.

### Key Features

*   **Terminal-Based Interface:** A responsive, native, themeable terminal UI.
*   **Multiple AI Models:** Supports 75+ LLM providers through [Models.dev](https://models.dev/), including local models..
*   **Language Server Protocol Integration:** opencode natively supports many LSP Servers which means that, if a edit introduced any syntax or langauge specific errors they get feed directly back into the LLM.
*   **Client/Server Architecture:** opencode uses a client/server architecture, which allows you to run the AI model on a separate machine from your development machine. This can be useful for a variety of reasons, such as if you want to have multiple Agents run on the same Project.
*   **Sharable Links:** share your opencode session with other developers to show them your work or for debug purposes. 

opencode is a powerful and flexible tool for any developer who wants to leverage the power of AI in their daily workflow. Its terminal-based interface, its support for multiple AI models, and its modular architecture make it a valuable addition to any developer's toolkit.
